# Bookstars API

API that stores the data for the Bookstars - Reviews & Ratings

***INSERT WIREFRAMES HERE***

## Technologies Used 

Bookstars makes use of two third party APIs (NYTs Bestselling Books and Google Books), as well as our own API using Node. Our API holds the information for each rating and review.

## Getting Started

In our API, you can view the ratings and reviews for each book by inputing the following into your browser: 

> https://glacial-tundra-96946.herokuapp.com/api/books/title/{booktitle}

> For Example:

> https://glacial-tundra-96946.herokuapp.com/api/books/title/MAL'S%20SPELL%20BOOK

It is recommended you find a book on the deployed web application first, then search for that book in the API. This makes it more likely the book you are curious about has already populated reviews!
