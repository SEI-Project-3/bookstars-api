# Bookstars API

API that stores the data for the Bookstars - Reviews & Ratings

***INSERT WIREFRAMES HERE***

## Technologies Used 

Bookstars makes use of two third party APIs (NYTs Bestselling Books and Google Books), as well as our own API using Node. Our API holds the information for each rating and review.

## Getting Started

There are a number of ways to navigate our app! On the homepage, you can view the bestselling fiction books for that week.  Using our navigation bar, you can look at the top 15 best-selling books for 5 categories: Fiction, Nonfiction, Young Adult, Middle Grades, and Children.

Using our search function, you can search for any book you would like, and it will generate the information for you.  When using the search feature, be as specific as possible about your book -- this will generate the most accurate result.

Once you've navigated to a book's detail page (either through clicking on one or by searching for one), you can view basic inforamtion about the book, as well as any ratings and reviews that have been left so far. You can also add your own and see it populate to the page in real-time.
